1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python
Data Inspection: Begin by loading your dataset and inspecting its structure. Check the types of data in each column and identify any anomalies such as missing values or incorrect data types.

Data Cleaning:

Missing Values: Address any missing data by either filling with appropriate values (mean, median, mode) or by removing the affected rows/columns.
Duplicates: Check for and remove any duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.
Data Type Conversion: Convert columns like Order Date and Delivery Date to datetime formats. Ensure numeric fields are correctly formatted.
Exploratory Analysis:

Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of your numeric data.
Visualizations: Use histograms, bar charts, and boxplots to visualize distributions and spot potential outliers.
Correlation Analysis: Identify relationships between variables using correlation matrices and heatmaps.
Feature Engineering: Create any new features that might help in your analysis or improve model performance. This might include aggregating data, deriving new variables, or converting categorical data into numerical form.

2. Power BI Analysis and Dashboard Creation
Data Import: Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Data Transformation: Use Power Query to further refine your data if necessary, including additional cleaning, transformations, or feature creation.

Visualizations:

KPI Indicators: Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to highlight important metrics such as total sales, average order value, etc.
Time-Series Analysis: Visualize trends over time using line charts for metrics like sales, orders, or delivery times.
Geographical Analysis: Use maps to display metrics like sales or customer distribution by country or state.
Product Analysis: Create visuals to compare performance across different products, categories, or brands.
Dashboard Design: Arrange your visualizations in a clear, user-friendly dashboard. Ensure it's easy to interpret and navigate, with filters for users to explore different aspects of the data.

3. Report Writing
Introduction: Provide an overview of the dataset and the purpose of your analysis.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Explain the steps taken during data cleaning, including how missing data and duplicates were handled.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Summarize key findings from your EDA, including insights derived from descriptive statistics and visualizations.

Power BI Insights: Discuss the main takeaways from your Power BI dashboard, including trends, outliers, and key metrics.
